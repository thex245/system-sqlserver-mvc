# system-sqlserver-mvc
basic system that allow registering, editing and validation. at this point still working on it (i had left this project aside but I started working on it again, but right now it's just a base for a bigger project to save time if necessary to develop something bigger

//
it's using some techs that i will be adding and why they are being added there:

- ASP.NET MVC 5 â€“ to define the structure of the system with mvc (I like to keep it looking good and organized)
- SQL Server 2014/16 - i like to use it always that i need to store data at all, integrates with EF
- EF 6 - map c# classes to database automatically, so, less sql
- "System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations" - im improving specificaly into this, used for automatic validations and rules into the code (yes, i love automation)
